= Metrics via HTTP endpoints


* Authors: https://github.com/pilhuhn[Heiko W. Rupp], https://github.com/raymondlam[Raymond Lam], https://github.com/Channyboy[David Chan]



== Introduction

To ensure reliable operation of the software it is necessary to monitor essential
system parameters. This enhancement proposes the addition of well-known monitoring
endpoints and metrics for each process adhering to the microprofile standard.

This proposal does not talk about health checks. There is a separate proposal
https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-evolution-process/issues/14[MP-0003: Health Check Proposal].

Mailinglist thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/microprofile/jIZAKiu76ys[Monitoring and Healthcheck requirements]

== Motivation

Reliable service of a platform needs monitoring. There is already JMX as
standard to expose metrics, but remote-JMX is not easy to deal with and
especially does not fit well in a polyglot environment where other services
are not running on the JVM.
To enable monitoring in an easy fashion it is necessary that all microprofile
implementations follow a certain standard with respect to (base) API path,
data types involved, always available metrics and return codes used.

=== Difference to health checks

Health checks are primarily targeted at a quick yes/no response to the
question "Is my application still running ok?". Modern systems that
schedule the starting of applications (e.g. Kubernetes) use this
information to restart the application if the answer is 'no'.

Metrics on the other hand can help to determine the health. Beyond this
they serve to pinpoint issues, provide long term trend data for capacity
planning and pro-active discovery of issues (e.g. disk usage growing without bounds).
Metrics can also help those scheduling systems to make decisions when to scale the application
to run on more or less machines depending on the metrical values.

== Proposed solution

Data is exposed via REST over http under the `/metrics` base path

* Metrics will respond to GET requests and are exposed in a tree like fashion with sub-trees for various cases described below.
* A 'shadow tree' that responds to OPTIONS will provide the metadata
* All data is at least exposed as `application/json` data type.
* The api is discoverable. GETting a base object will list references to children

Data access must honour the http response codes, especially

* 200 for successful retrieval of an object
* 204 when retrieving a subtree that would exist, but has no content. E.g. when the application-specific subtree has no application specific metrics defined.
* 404 if an directly-addressed item does not exist. This may be a non-existing sub-tree or non-existing object
* 500 to indicate that a request failed due to "bad health". The body SHOULD contain details if possible { "details": <text> }

The Api MUST NOT return a 500 Internal Server Error code to represent a non-existing resource.

== Detailed design (draft)

=== REST-Api Objects

Api-objects MAY include one or more metrics as in

[source]
----
{
  "thread-count" : 33,
  "peak-thread-count" : 47,
  "total-started-thread-count" : 49,
  "current-thread-cpu-time" : 66855000,
  "current-thread-user-time" : 64003000
}
----

or

[source]
----
{
  "count": 45
}
----

=== Metadata

Metric values MUST have metadata to attach semantics to the values.
Metadata is returned as an array of objects with the following content:

* unit: a fixed set of string units from e.g. [1], [UoM] or [Metrics2.0]
* type:
** counter: a monotonically increasing or decreasing numeric value (e.g. total number of requests received)
** gauge: a numeric value that can arbitrarily go up and down (e.g. cpu or disk usage)
** bool: a boolean value which can be `true` or `false`
** string: a string
* description (optional): A human readable description of the metric
* displayName (optional): A human readable name of the metric for display purposes if the metric name is not
human readable. This could e.g. be the case when the metric name is a uuid.
* tags (optional): A list of key=value pairs, which are separated by comma.

Example:

if `GET /metrics/base/fooVal` exposes:

[source]
----
{"fooVal": 12345}
----

then `OPTIONS /metrics/base/fooVal` will expose:

[source]
----
[
  {"fooVal": {
      "unit": "ms",
      "type": "gauge",
      "description": "The size of foo after each request",
      "displayName": "Size of foo",
      "tags": "app=webshop"
     }
  }
]
----

If the endpoint exposes multiple values like this:

[source]
----
{
  "fooVal": 12345,
  "barVal": 42
}
----

then Metadata is returned as follows:

[source]
----
[
  {"fooVal": {
      "unit": "ms",
      "type": "gauge",
      "description": "The duration of foo after each request",
      "displayName": "Duration of foo",
      "tags": "app=webshop"
     }
  },
  {"barVal": {
      "unit": "mbytes",
      "type": "gauge",
      "tags": "component=backend,app=webshop"
     }
  }
]
----

Metadata must not change over the lifetime of a process (i.e. it is not allowed
to return the units as seconds in one retrieval and as hours in a subsequent one).
The reason behind it is that e.g. a monitoring agent on Kubernetes may read the
metadata once it sees the new container and store it. It may not periodically
re-query the process for the metadata.

In fact that metadata should probably not change during the life-time of the
whole container image or an application, as all containers spawned from it
will be "the same" and form part of an app, where it would be confusing in
an overall view if the same metric has different metadata.

Metadata SHOULD support caching via cache control headers and SHOULD reply with a 304 Not Modified response accordingly.

== Base metrics

Base metrics is a list of metrics that all vendors need to implement. Optional base metrics are recommended to be implemented but are not required. These metrics are exposed under `/metrics/base`

The following is a list of required and optional base metrics. All metrics have `Multi: false` unless otherwise stated.

The following is a list of required metrics if the application uses the data. E.g. if the application does not use any data source, then there will be no data sources listed.

* java.lang.* metrics from the MBeanServer (read-only metrics, no writing, no operations)
 Q: should this really include all values?
* especially Garbage collector stuff is pretty convoluted
* List of datasources with connections in use (list can be empty)
* ...

Values from the MBean server are encoded with `MBean-Name/attribute[#field]` name to retrieve a single attribute.

E.g. `GET /metrics/base/java.lang:type=Memory/ObjectPendingFinalizationCount` to only get that count.
For MBeans attributes that are of type `CompositeData`, the `#field` will return a single item of this composite
data.

Q: should we expose current total memory usage (heap+non heap) in a separate item? I am in favour of that as other non-JVM
environments do may not be able to report fine grained values, but only a total.

Q: should current thread count be exposed in a separate item?

== Vendor specific data

It is possible for microprofile server implementors to supply their specific metrics data on top of the basic set listed above.
Vendor specific metrics are exposed under `/metrics/vendor`.

Examples for vendor specific data could be metrics like

* OSGi statistics if the Microprofile-enabled container internally runs on top of OSGi.
* Statistics of some internal caching modules

Vendor specific metrics are not supposed to be portable between different implementations
of Microprofile

== Application specific data

It is possible for applications to expose their own application metrics on top of the basic set listed above.
Application specific metrics are exposed under `/metrics/application`.

Application specific metrics are supposed to be portable to other implementations of
the Microprofile if the application can run there unmodified.

== Security

It must be possible to secure the endpoints via the usual means

Accessing `/metrics` without valid credentials must return a 401 Unauthorised header

Q: should we return 503 Service Unavailable if the server detects an internal bad health state when authorisation is required or stick to a 401 to not expose additional hints to attackers.

A server SHOULD implement TLS encryption by default

== Setup of metric sources

Metrics that are exposed need to be configured in the server.
There are two different approaches depending on the scope of the data, which are described next.

=== Required + Vendor specific metrics

Each vendor of a Microprofile-compliant server can implement setting up the metrics in _base_ and _vendor_ scopes in a
vendor-specific way. The metrics can be hard coded into the server or read from a configuration file.
The Appendix shows a possible data format for such a configuration.
The configuration and set up of  _base_ and _vendor_ scopes  are an implementation detail and are not expected to be portable across vendors.


=== Application metrics

Application specific metrics can not be backed into the server as they are supposed to be provided by the application at runtime.

To access application metrics and its metadata a class `ApplicationMetric` is made available which can be injected
via CDI

[source]
----
@Inject
ApplicationMetric applicationMetric;
----

This can then be used to register MetaData

[source]
----
MetadataEntry demoEntry = new MetadataEntry("demo",  // Name, mandatory
        null,                                        // display name
        "Just a demo value",                         // description
        "gauge",                                     // type
        "none");                                     // unit
demoEntry.setTags("app=demo");
applicationMetric.registerMetric("demo", demoEntry);
----

Registration of a metric is mandatory before it can be used (and is published over the REST api)

Writing a value:

[source]
----
applicationMetric.bumpValue("demo",1);  // Increment by 1
----

or

[source]
----
applicationMetric.setValue("demo",42);   // set to absolute value 42
----

=== Supplying of Tags

Tags can be supplied in two ways

* At the level of a metric shown in the above examples
* At the application server level by passing the list of tags in an environment variable `MP_METRICS_TAGS`

`export MP_METRICS_TAGS=app=shop,tier=integration`

Global tags will be appended to the per-metric tags.
