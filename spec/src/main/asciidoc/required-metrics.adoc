== Required Metrics

Base metrics is a list of metrics that all vendors need to implement. Optional base metrics are recommended to be implemented but are not required.
These metrics are exposed under `/metrics/base`.

The following is a list of required and optional base metrics. All metrics are singletons and have `Multi:` set to `false` unless otherwise stated.
Visit <<architecture#meta-data-def>> for the meaning of each key

NOTE: Although vendors are required to implement these base metrics, some virtual machines can not provide them.
Vendors should either use other metrics that are close enough as substitute or not fill these base metrics at all.

=== (Optional) REST

Metrics gathered from REST stats are optional and therefore may not be available in every implementation.

The MicroProfile Metrics runtime will track metrics from RESTful resource method calls during runtime (i.e GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH, HEAD). It is up to the implementation to decide how to enable the REST metrics.

=== Mapped and Unmapped Exceptions

The metrics defined below will treat a REST request that ends in a mapped exception or an unmapped exception differently. For the MicroProfile Metrics runtime, mapped exceptions and _succesful_ REST requests should be considered and handled the same way. This is because mapped exceptions are expected by the developer and may then be handled appropriately as part of the application's expected behviour.  Unmapped exceptions on the other hand are unexpected and can skew metric data if its' respective REST request is recorded. To avoid contaminating the metric values with these _unsuccesful_ REST requests, the below metrics may omit tracking a REST request that ends with an unmapped exception. There are also metrics that purposely track REST requests that end with an unmapped exception.

*(Optional) RESTRequest*
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Name| REST.request
|DisplayName| Total Requests and Response Time
|Type| SimpleTimer
|Unit| None
|Multi| true
|Tags| {class=%s1,method=%s2}
|Description| The number of invocations and total response time of this RESTful resource method since the start of the server. The metric will not record the elapsed time nor count of a REST request if it resulted in an *unmapped* exception. Also tracks the highest recorded time duration within the previous completed full minute and lowest recorded time duration within the previous completed full minute.
|Notes|With an asynchronous request the *timing* that is tracked by the REST metric must incorporate the time spent by the asynchronous call.

The `%s1` should be substituted with the fully qualified name of the RESTful resource class. 

The `%s2` should be substituted with the name of the RESTful resource method and appended with its parameter types using an underscore `\_`.  Multiple parameter types are appended one after another (e.g. `<methodName>_<paramType1>_<paramType2>`).

Parameter type formatting rules: +
- The paramter types are fully qualified (e.g. `java.lang.Object`). +
- Array paramter types will be formatted as `paramType[]` (e.g `java.lang.Object[]`). +
- A Vararg parameter will be treated as an array. +
- Generics will be ignored. For example `List<String>` will be formatted as `java.util.List`.

|===

*(Optional) RESTRequestUnmappedExceptions*
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Name| REST.request.unmappedException.total
|DisplayName| Total Unmapped Exceptions count
|Type| Counter
|Unit| None
|Multi| true
|Tags| {class=%s1,method=%s2}
|Description| The total number of unmapped exceptions that occur from this RESTful resouce method since the start of the server.
|Notes| The `%s1` should be substituted with the fully qualified name of the RESTful resource class.

The `%s2` should be substituted with the name of the RESTful resource method and appended with its parameter types using an underscore `\_`.  Multiple parameter types are appended one after another (e.g. `<methodName>_<paramType1>_<paramType2>`).

Parameter type formatting rules: +
- The paramter types are fully qualified (e.g. `java.lang.Object`). +
- If the implementation supports array parameters, array parameter types will be formatted as `paramType[]` (e.g `java.lang.Object[]`). +
- A Vararg parameter will be treated as an array. +
- Generics will be ignored. For example `List<String>` will be formatted as `java.util.List`.

|===


For example given the following RESTful resource:
[source, java]
----

package org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.demo;

@ApplicationScoped
public class RestDemo {

  @POST
  public void postMethod(Object o, String... s){
      ...
  }
}
----

The OpenMetrics formatted rest metrics would be:
[source]
----
# TYPE base_REST_request_total counter
base_REST_request_total{class="org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.demo.RestDemo",method="postMethod_java.lang.Object_java.lang.String[]"} 1
# TYPE base_REST_request_elapsedTime_seconds gauge
base_REST_request_elapsedTime_seconds{class="org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.demo.RestDemo",method="postMethod_java.lang.Object_java.lang.String[]"} 1.000
# TYPE base_REST_request_maxTimeDuration_seconds gauge
base_REST_request_maxTimeDuration_seconds{class="org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.demo.RestDemo",method="postMethod_java.lang.Object_java.lang.String[]"} 1.000
# TYPE base_REST_request_minTimeDuration_seconds gauge
base_REST_request_minTimeDuration_seconds{class="org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.demo.RestDemo",method="postMethod_java.lang.Object_java.lang.String[]"} 1.000
# TYPE base_REST_request_unmappedException_total counter
base_REST_request_unmappedException_total{class="org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.demo.RestDemo",method="postMethod_java.lang.Object_java.lang.String[]"} 0
