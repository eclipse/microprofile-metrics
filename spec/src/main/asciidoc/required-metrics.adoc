[[required-metrics]]
== Required Metrics

Base metrics is a list of metrics that all vendors need to implement. Optional base metrics are recommended to be implemented but are not required.
These metrics are exposed under `/metrics/base`.

The following is a list of required and optional base metrics. All metrics are singletons and have `Multi:` set to `false` unless otherwise stated.
Visit <<architecture#meta-data-def>> for the meaning of each key

NOTE: Although vendors are required to implement these base metrics, some virtual machines can not provide them.
Vendors should either use other metrics that are close enough as substitute or not fill these base metrics at all.

|Description| Displays the maximum amount of heap memory in bytes that can be used for memory management. This attribute displays -1 if the maximum heap memory size is undefined. This amount of memory is not guaranteed to be available for memory management if it is greater than the amount of committed memory.

|MBean| java.lang:type=Memory/HeapMemoryUsage#max
|===

*GCCount*

|===
|Name| gc.total
|DisplayName| Garbage Collection Count

|Description|  Displays the total number of collections that have occurred. This attribute lists -1 if the collection count is undefined for this collector.
|MBean| java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,name=%s/CollectionCount

=== (Optional) REST

Metrics gathered from REST stats are optional and therefore may not be available in every implementation.

The MicroProfile Metrics runtime will track metrics from RESTful resource method calls during runtime (i.e GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH, HEAD). It is up to the implementation to decide how to enable the REST metrics.

*(Optional) RESTRequests*
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Name| REST.request
|DisplayName| Total Requests and Response Time
|Type| SimpleTimer
|Unit| None
|Multi| true
|Tags| {class=%s1,method=%s2}
|Description| The number of invocations and total response time of this RESTful resource method since the start of the server.
|Notes|With an asynchronous request the *timing* that is tracked by the REST metric must incorporate the time spent by the asynchronous call.

The `%s1` should be substituted with the fully qualified name of the RESTful resource class. 

The `%s2` should be substituted with the name of the RESTful resource method and appended with its parameter types using an underscore `\_`.  Multiple parameter types are appended one after another (e.g. `<methodName>_<paramType1>_<paramType2>`).

Parameter type formatting rules: +
- The paramter types are fully qualified (e.g. `java.lang.Object`). +
- Array paramter types will be formatted as `paramType[]` (e.g `java.lang.Object[]`). +
- A Vararg parameter will be treated as an array. +
- Generics will be ignored. For example `List<String>` will be formatted as `java.util.List`.

|===


For example given the following RESTful resource:
[source, java]
----

package org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.demo;

@ApplicationScoped
public class RestDemo {

  @POST
  public void postMethod(String... s, Object o){
      ...
  }
}
----

The OpenMetrics formatted rest metrics would be:
[source]
----
# TYPE base_REST_request_total counter
base_REST_request_total{class="org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.demo.RestDemo",method="postMethod_java.lang.String[]_java.lang.Object"} 1
# TYPE base_REST_request_elapsedTime_seconds gauge
base_REST_request_elapsedTime_seconds{class="org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.demo.RestDemo",method="postMethod_java.lang.String[]_java.lang.Object"} 1.000
----
