= Metrics for Eclipse Microprofile

include::license-alv2.asciidoc[]

== Introduction

To ensure reliable operation of the software it is necessary to monitor essential
system parameters. This enhancement proposes the addition of well-known monitoring
endpoints and metrics for each process adhering to the Eclipse Microprofile standard.

This proposal does not talk about health checks. There is a separate specification for
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health[Health Checks].

=== Motivation

Reliable service of a platform needs monitoring. There is already JMX as
standard to expose metrics, but remote-JMX is not easy to deal with and
especially does not fit well in a polyglot environment where other services
are not running on the JVM.
To enable monitoring in an easy fashion it is necessary that all Microprofile
implementations follow a certain standard with respect to (base) API path,
data types involved, always available metrics and return codes used.

=== Difference to health checks

Health checks are primarily targeted at a quick yes/no response to the
question "Is my application still running ok?". Modern systems that
schedule the starting of applications (e.g. Kubernetes) use this
information to restart the application if the answer is 'no'.

Metrics on the other hand can help to determine the health. Beyond this
they serve to pinpoint issues, provide long term trend data for capacity
planning and pro-active discovery of issues (e.g. disk usage growing without bounds).
Metrics can also help those scheduling systems to make decisions when to scale the application
to run on more or less machines depending on the metrical values.


== Architecture


This chapter describes the architectural overview of how metrics are setup, stored and exposed for consumption.
This chapter also lists the various scopes of metrics.

See section <<required-metrics>> for more information regarding metrics that are required for each vendor.

See section <<app-metrics-api>> for more information regarding the application metrics programming model.

[[metrics-setup]]
=== Metrics Setup

Metrics that are exposed need to be configured in the server. On top of the pure metrics, metadata needs to be provided.

The following three sets of sub-resource (scopes) are exposed.

* base: metrics that all Microprofile vendors have to provide
* vendor: vendor specific metrics (optional)
* application: application-specific metrics (optional)

NOTE: It is expected that a future version of this specification will also have a sub-resource for integrations
with other specifications of Microprofile.

==== Scopes

===== Required Base metrics

Each vendor of a Microprofile-compliant server can implement setting up the metrics in the _base_ scope in a
vendor-specific way.
The metrics can be hard coded into the server or read from a configuration file or supplied via the Java-API described in <<app-metrics-api>>.
The Appendix shows a possible data format for such a configuration.
The configuration and set up of the _base_ scope is an implementation detail and is not expected to be portable across vendors.

Section <<required-metrics>> lists the required metrics. This list also includes a few items marked as optional.
These are listed here as they are dependent on the underlying JVM and not the server and thus fit better in _base_ scope
than the _vendor_ one.

===== Application metrics

Application specific metrics can not be backed into the server as they are supposed to be provided by the
application at runtime. Therefore a Java API is provided. Application specific metrics are supposed to be
portable to other implementations of the Microprofile. That means that an application written to this
specification which exposes metrics, can expose the same metrics on a different compliant server
without change.

Details of this Java API are described in <<app-metrics-api>>.

Application specific metrics are exposed under `/metrics/application`.


===== Vendor specific Metrics

It is possible for Microprofile server implementors to supply their specific metrics data on top
of the basic set of required metrics.
Vendor specific metrics are exposed under `/metrics/vendor`.

Examples for vendor specific data could be metrics like:

* OSGi statistics if the Microprofile-enabled container internally runs on top of OSGi.
* Statistics of some internal caching modules

Vendor specific metrics are not supposed to be portable between different implementations
of Microprofile servers, even if they are compliant with the same version of this specification.


==== Supplying of Tags

Tags (or labels) play an important role in modern microservices and microservice scheduling systems (like e.g. Kubernetes).
Application code can run on any node and can be re-scheduled to a different node at any time. Each container in such
an environment gets its own ID; when the container is stopped and a new one started for the same image, it will get a
different id. The classical mapping of host/node and application runtime on it, therefore no longer works.

Tags have taken over the role to for example identify an application (`app=myShop`), the tier inside the application
(`tier=database` or `tier=app_server`) and also the node/container id. Aggregation of metrics can then work over label
queries (Give me the API hit count for `app=myShop && tier=app_server`).

Tags can be supplied in two ways:

* At the level of a metric as described in <<app-metrics-api>>.
* At the application server level by passing the list of tags in an environment variable `MP_METRICS_TAGS`.

.Set up global tags
[source,bash]
----
export MP_METRICS_TAGS=app=shop,tier=integration
----

Global tags will be appended to the per-metric tags.

[[meta-data-def]]
==== Metadata

For all exposed metrics, matching metadata is exposed and needs to be provided by the setup. This is true for all scopes.

TIP: While technically it is possible to expose metrics without (some) of the metadata, it helps tooling and also
operators when correct metadata is provided, as this helps getting a context and an explanation of the metric.

The Metadata:

* unit: a fixed set of string units
* type:
** counter: a monotonically increasing or decreasing numeric value (e.g. total number of requests received).
** gauge: a numeric value that can arbitrarily go up and down (e.g. cpu or disk usage).
** meter: a metric which measures mean throughput and one-, five-, and fifteen-minute exponentially-weighted moving average throughput.
** histogram: a metric which calculates the distribution of a value.
** timer: A timer metric which aggregates timing durations and provides duration statistics, plus throughput statistics.
* description (optional): A human readable description of the metric.
* displayName (optional): A human readable name of the metric for display purposes if the metric name is not
human readable. This could e.g. be the case when the metric name is a uuid.
* tags (optional): A list of `key=value` pairs, which are separated by comma. See also <<_supplying_of_tags>>.

Metadata must not change over the lifetime of a process (i.e. it is not allowed
to return the units as seconds in one retrieval and as hours in a subsequent one).
The reason behind it is that e.g. a monitoring agent on Kubernetes may read the
metadata once it sees the new container and store it. It may not periodically
re-query the process for the metadata.

IMPORTANT: In fact, metadata should not change during the life-time of the
whole container image or an application, as all containers spawned from it
will be "the same" and form part of an app, where it would be confusing in
an overall view if the same metric has different metadata.

=== Metric Registry
<TO DO>

[[rest-api]]
=== Exposing metrics via REST API

Data is exposed via REST over http under the `/metrics` base path in two default data formats for `GET` requests:

* Json format.
* Prometheus text format.

Formats are detailed below.

Data access must honour the http response codes, especially

* 200 for successful retrieval of an object
* 204 when retrieving a subtree that would exist, but has no content. E.g. when the application-specific subtree has no application specific metrics defined.
* 404 if an directly-addressed item does not exist. This may be a non-existing sub-tree or non-existing object
* 500 to indicate that a request failed due to "bad health". The body SHOULD contain details if possible { "details": <text> }

The Api MUST NOT return a 500 Internal Server Error code to represent a non-existing resource.

Accessing `/metrics` will return all registered metrics.

Accessing `/metrics/<scope>` will only return metrics registered for the respective scope. Scopes are listed in <<metrics-setup>>.


==== JSON format

* Metrics will respond to GET requests and are exposed in a tree like fashion with sub-trees for the sub-resources mentioned in the previous section.
A sub-tree that does not contain data can be omitted.
* A 'shadow tree' that responds to OPTIONS will provide the metadata.

*REST-Api Objects*

Api-objects MAY include one or more metrics as in

[source,json]
----
{
  "thread-count" : 33,
  "peak-thread-count" : 47,
  "total-started-thread-count" : 49,
  "current-thread-cpu-time" : 66855000,
  "current-thread-user-time" : 64003000
}
----

or

[source]
----
{
  "count": 45
}
----

In case `/metrics` is requested, then the data for the scopes are wrapped in the scope name:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "base": {
     "thread-count" : 33,
     "peak-thread-count" : 47,
  },
  "vendor": [...]
}
----

*Metadata*


Metadata is exposed in a tree-like fashion with sub-trees for the sub-resources mentioned previously.
The same wrapping of scopes applies as for metrics.

Example:

If `GET /metrics/base/fooVal` exposes:

[source]
----
{"fooVal": 12345}
----

then `OPTIONS /metrics/base/fooVal` will expose:

[source]
----

{
  "fooVal": {
    "unit": "ms",
    "type": "gauge",
    "description": "The size of foo after each request",
    "displayName": "Size of foo",
    "tags": "app=webshop"
  }
}

----

If `GET /metrics/base` exposes multiple values like this:

.Example of exposed metrics data
[source]
----
{
  "fooVal": 12345,
  "barVal": 42
}
----

then `OPTIONS /metrics/base` exposes:

.Example of Json output of Metadata
[source]
----
{
  "fooVal": {
    "unit": "ms",
    "type": "gauge",
    "description": "The duration of foo after each request",
    "displayName": "Duration of foo",
    "tags": "app=webshop"
  },
  "barVal": {
    "unit": "mbytes",
    "type": "gauge",
    "tags": "component=backend,app=webshop"
  }
}
----


==== Prometheus format

Data is exposed in text format as described in
https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#text-format-details[Prometheus text format] when
the GET request asks for `text/plain` encoding.

The metadata will be included inline in the Prometheus text format, specified by it.

TIP: Users that want to write tools to transform the metadata can still request the metadata via OPTIONS
request and json media type.

The above json example would look like this in Prometheus format

.Example of Prometheus output
[source]
----
# TYPE base:foo_val_seconds gauge   <1>
# HELP base:foo_val_seconds The duration of foo after each request <2>
base:foo_val_seconds{app="webshop"} 12.345  <3>
# TYPE base:bar_val_bytes gauge <1>
base:bar_val_bytes{component="backend", app="webshop"} 42000 <3>
----
<1> Metric names are turned from camel case into snake_case.
<2> The description goes into the HELP line
<3> Metric names gets the base unit of the family appended with `_` and defined labels. Values are scaled accordingly

===== Translation rules for metric names

Prometheus text format does not allow for all characters and adds the base unit of a family to the name.

* Dot (`.`), Space (` `), Dash (`-`) are translated to underscore (`_`).
* Scope is always starts the metric name.
* Scope and name are separated by colon (`:`).
* camelCase is translated to camel_case
* Double underscore is translated to single underscore
* Colon-underscore (`:_`) is translated to single colon
* The unit is appended to the name, separated by underscore. See also below.


===== Handling of tags

Metric tags are appended to the metric name in curly braces `{` and `}` and are separated by comma.
Each tag is a key-value-pair in the format of `<key>="<value>"`.

===== Handling of units

Units are appended as the base unit of the respective family. Metric values are scaled accordingly.

Unit families and their base units are described under https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#base-units[Prometheus metric names, Base units].

Families and Prometheus base units are:

|===
| Family | Base unit

| Bit    | bytes
| Byte   | bytes
| Time   | seconds
| Percent | ratio (normally ratio is A_per_B, but there are exceptions like `disk_usage_ratio`)
|===

==== Security

It must be possible to secure the endpoints via the usual means. The definition of 'usual means' is in
this version of the specification implementation specific.

In case of a secured endpoint, accessing `/metrics` without valid credentials must return a `401 Unauthorised` header.

A server SHOULD implement TLS encryption by default.

It is allowed to ignore security for trusted origins (e.g. localhost)


[[required-metrics]]
== Required Metrics

Base metrics is a list of metrics that all vendors need to implement. Optional base metrics are recommended to be implemented but are not required.
These metrics are exposed under `/metrics/base`.

The following is a list of required and optional base metrics. All metrics have Multi: false unless otherwise stated.
Visit <<meta-data-def>> for the meaning of each key

Values from the MBean server are encoded with `MBean-Name/attribute[#field]` name to retrieve a single attribute.
E.g. `GET /metrics/base/java.lang:type=Memory/ObjectPendingFinalizationCount` to only get that count.
For MBeans attributes that are of type `CompositeData`, the `#field` will return a single item of this composite
data.

[[app-metrics-api]]
== Application Metrics Programming Model

Microprofile Metrics provides a way to register Application-specific metrics to allow applications to expose metrics in
the _application_ scope (see <<_scopes>> for the description of scopes).

Metrics and their metadata are added to a _Metric Registry_ upon definition and can afterwards have their values set
and retrieved via the Java-API and also be exposed via the REST-Api (see <<rest-api>>).

TIP: Implementors of this specification can use the Java API to also expose metrics for _base_ and _vendor_ scope by
using the respective Metric Registry.

In order to make setting the values easier, Annotations are made available.

.Example set-up of two Gauge metrics
[source,java]
----
@Gauge(unit = MetricUnit.MEGABYTE) <1>
int diskUsage;

@Gauge(name = "queueSize")         <2>
public int getQueueSize() {
  return queue.size;
}
----
<1> The metric is of type Gauge and the values are in Megabytes
<2> No unit is given, to `MetricUnit.NONE` is used, an explicit name is provided

NOTE: The programming API follows Dropwizard Metrics 3.2.3 API, but with local changes.
It is expected that many existing DropWizard Metrics based applications can easily be
ported over by exchanging the package names.

It will be possible to use the non-annotations API, but using the annotations is preferred.

=== Responsibility of the Microprofile Metrics implementation

* The implementation must scan the application at deploy time for <<api-annotations>> and register the
Metrics along with their metadata in the _application_ MetricsRegistry.
* The implementation must watch the annotated objects and update its internal data structures when the values of the
annotated objects change.
* The implementation must expose the values of the objects registered in the MetricsRegistry via REST-API as described
in <<rest-api>>.
* Metrics registered via non-annotations API need their values be set via updates from the application code.
* The implementation must flag duplicate metrics upon registration and reject the duplicate.
A duplicate metric is a metric that has the same scope and name as an existing one.


=== Base Package

All Java-Classes are in the top-level package `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics` or one of its sub-packages.

[[api-annotations]]
=== Annotations

All Annotations are in the `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.annotation` package

The following Annotations exist, see below for common fields:

[cols="1,1,3,2"]
|===
|Annotation | Applies to |  Description | Default Unit

|@Counted | M, C, T | Denotes a counter | MetricUnit.NONE
|@Gauge   | M, F | Denotes a gauge.  | _none_ Must be supplied by the user
|@Metered | M, C, T  | Denotes a meter which counts the invocations of the annotated object. | MetricUnit.NANOSECOND
|@Metric  | M, F, P | An annotation requesting that a metric should be injected. This annotation can be used on the fields
    of type `Meter`, `Timer`, `Counter`, and `Histogram`. | MetricUnit.NONE
|@Timed   | M, C, T | An annotation for marking a constructor or method of an annotated object as timed.
    The metric of type Timer records the time it took to invoke the annotated object. | MetricUnit.NONE
|===
(C=Constructor, F=Field, M=Method, P=Parameter, T=Type)


[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|Annotation | Description | Default

|@RegistryType| Qualifies the type of Metric Registry to inject.|  _application_ (scope)
|===

==== Fields

All annotations (Except `RegistryType`) have the following fields that correspond to the metadata fields described
in <<meta-data-def>>.

`String name`:: Optional. Sets the name of the metric. If not explicitly given it is determined from the annotated object and the
fully qualified name of the surrounding class, unless `absolute` is true.
`boolean absolute`:: If `true` use the given name as an absolute name of the metric. If `false`, use the given name relative to
the annotated class. Default value is `false`.
`String displayName`:: Optional. A human readable display name for metadata.
`String description`:: Optional. A description of the metric.
`MetricUnit unit`:: Unit of the metric. For `@Gauge` no default is provided.
`String[] tags`:: Optional. Array of Strings in the `<key>=<value>` format to supply special tags to a metric.

NOTE: Implementors are encouraged to issue warnings in the server log if metadata is missing. Implementors
MAY stop the deployment of an application if Metadata is missing.

[[annotated-naming-convention]]
==== Annotated Naming Convention
Annotated metrics are registered into the _application_ `MetricRegistry` with the name based on the annotation's `name` and `absolute` fields.

.Example of annotated metric names
[source, java]
----
package com.example;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.Counter;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.annotation.Metric;

public class Colors {

  @Inject
  @Metric
  Counter redCount;

  @Inject
  @Metric(name="blue")
  Counter blueCount;

  @Inject
  @Metric(absolute=true)
  Counter greenCount;

  @Inject
  @Metric(name="purple", absolute=true)
  Counter purpleCount;
}
----
The above bean would produce the following entries in the `MetricRegistry`
----
com.example.redCount
com.example.blue
greenCount
purple
----


==== @Counted
An annotation for marking a method, constructor, or type as a counter.

The implementation must support the following annotation targets:

  * `CONSTRUCTOR`
  * `METHOD`
  * `TYPE`

In addition to the metadata fields, `@Counted` has the following field:

`monotonic`:: If `false` (default), the counter is decremented when the annotated method returns, counting current invocations of the annotated method.
If `true`, the counter increases monotonically, counting total invocations of the annotated method.


The following lists the behavior for each annotation target.

===== CONSTRUCTOR

When a constructor is annotated, the implementation must register a counter for the constructor using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. The counter is incremented and/or decremented according to the `monotonic` field when the constructor is invoked.

.Example of an annotated constructor
[source, java]
----
@Counted
public CounterBean() {
}
----

===== METHOD

When a method is annotated, the implementation must register a counter for the method using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. The counter is incremented and/or decremented according to the `monotonic` field when the method is invoked.

.Example of an annotated method
[source, java]
----
@Counted
public void run() {
}
----

===== TYPE
When a type/class is annotated, the implementation must register a counter for each of the constructor and methods using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. The counters are incremented and/or decremented according to the `monotonic` field when the corresponding constructor/method is invoked.

.Example of an annotated type/class
[source, java]
----
@Counted
public class CounterBean {

  public void countMethod1() {}
  public void countMethod2() {}

}
----

==== @Gauge
An annotation for marking a method of field as a gauge.

The implementation must support the following annotation targets:

  * `FIELD`
  * `METHOD`


The following lists the behavior for each annotation target.

===== FIELD

When a field is annotated, the implementation must register a gauge for the field using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. The gauge value and type is equal to the annotated field value and type.

.Example of an annotated field
[source, java]
----
@Gauge
long value;
----

===== METHOD

When a method is annotated, the implementation must register a gauge for the method using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. The gauge value and type is equal to the annotated method return value and type.

.Example of an annotated method
[source, java]
----
@Gauge
public long getValue() {
  return value;
}
----


==== @Metered
An annotation for marking a constructor or method as metered. The meter counts the invocations
of the constructor or method.

The implementation must support the following annotation targets:

  * `CONSTRUCTOR`
  * `METHOD`
  * `TYPE`

The following lists the behavior for each annotation target.

===== CONSTRUCTOR

When a constructor is annotated, the implementation must register a meter for the constructor using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. The meter is marked each time the constructor is invoked.

.Example of an annotated constructor
[source, java]
----
@Metered
public MeteredBean() {
}
----

===== METHOD

When a method is annotated, the implementation must register a meter for the method using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. The meter is marked each time the method is invoked.

.Example of an annotated method
[source, java]
----
@Metered
public void run() {
}
----

===== TYPE
When a type/class is annotated, the implementation must register a meter for each of the constructor and methods using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. The meters are marked each time the corresponding constructor/method is invoked.

.Example of an annotated type/class
[source, java]
----
@Metered
public class MeteredBean {

  public void meteredMethod1() {}
  public void meteredMethod2() {}

}
----

==== @Timed
An annotation for marking a constructor or method of an annotated object as timed.
The metric of type Timer records the time it took to invoke the annotated object.

The implementation must support the following annotation targets:

  * `CONSTRUCTOR`
  * `METHOD`
  * `TYPE`

The following lists the behavior for each annotation target.

===== CONSTRUCTOR

When a constructor is annotated, the implementation must register a timer for the constructor using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. Each time the constructor is invoked, the execution will be timed.

.Example of an annotated constructor
[source, java]
----
@Timed
public TimedBean() {
}
----

===== METHOD

When a method is annotated, the implementation must register a timer for the method using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. Each time the method is invoked, the execution will be timed.

.Example of an annotated method
[source, java]
----
@Timed
public void run() {
}
----

===== TYPE
When a type/class is annotated, the implementation must register a timer for each of the constructor and methods using the <<annotated-naming-convention>>. Each time a constructor/method is invoked, the execution will be timed with the corresponding timer.

.Example of an annotated type/class
[source, java]
----
@Timed
public class TimedBean {

  public void timedMethod1() {}
  public void timedMethod2() {}

}
----

==== @Metric
An annotation requesting that a metric should be injected. This annotation can be used on the fields of type `Meter`, `Timer`, `Counter`, and `Histogram`.

The implementation must support the following annotation targets:

  * `FIELD`
  * `METHOD`
  * `PARAMETER`

The following lists the behavior for each annotation target.

===== FIELD

When a field of type Meter, Timer, Counter or Histogram is annotated, the implementation must provide the registered metric to the application.
The implementation must register the metric for the field using the <<annotated-naming-convention>> if it does not already exist, otherwise it
will retrieve the metric from the registry and produce it to the application.

.Example of an annotated field
[source, java]
----
@Inject
@Metric("applicationCount")
Counter count;
----

===== METHOD

<TO DO>

===== PARAMETER
<TO DO>


[[metric-registry]]
=== Metric Registry

The `MetricRegistry` is used to maintain a collection of metrics along with their metadata.
There is one shared singleton of the `MetricRegistry` per scope (_application_, _base_, and _vendor_).
When metrics are registered using annotations, the metrics must be registered to the _application_ `MetricRegistry`.

When injected, the `@RegistryType` is used as a qualifier to selectively inject either the `APPLICATION`, `BASE`, or `VENDOR` registry.
If no qualifier is used, the default `MetricRegistry` returned is the `APPLICATION` registry.

==== @RegistryType
The `@RegistryType` can be used to retrieve the `MetricRegistry` for a specific scope.
The implementation must produce the corresponding `MetricRegistry` specified by the `RegistryType`.

NOTE:: The implementor can optionally provide a _read_only_ copy of the `MetricRegistry` for _base_ and _vendor_ scopes.

==== Application Metric Registry
The implementation must produce the _application_ `MetricRegistry` when no `RegistryType` is provided (`@Default`) or when the `RegistryType` is `APPLICATION`.

.Example of the application injecting the application registry
[source, java]
----
@Inject
MetricRegistry metricRegistry;
----

.is equivalent to
[source, java]
----
@Inject
@RegistryType(type=MetricRegistry.Type.APPLICATION)
MetricRegistry metricRegistry;
----

==== Base Metric Registry
The implementation must produce the _base_ `MetricRegistry` when the `RegistryType` is `BASE`. The _base_ `MetricRegistry` must contain the required metrics specified in <<required-metrics>>.

.Example of the application injecting the base registry
[source, java]
----
@Inject
@RegistryType(type=MetricRegistry.Type.BASE)
MetricRegistry baseRegistry;
----

==== Vendor Metric Registry
The implementation must produce the _vendor_ `MetricRegistry` when the `RegistryType` is `VENDOR`. The _vendor_ `MetricRegistry` must contain any vendor specific metrics.

.Example of the application injecting the vendor registry
[source, java]
----
@Inject
@RegistryType(type=MetricRegistry.Type.VENDOR)
MetricRegistry vendorRegistry;
----

=== Alternatives considered

There exists Jolokia as JMX-HTTP bridge. Using this for application specific metrics requires that those metrics
are exposed to JMX first, which are many users not familiar with.
