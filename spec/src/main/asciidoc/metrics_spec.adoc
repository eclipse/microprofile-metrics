= Metrics for Eclipse MicroProfile

include::license-alv2.asciidoc[]

== Introduction

To ensure reliable operation of software it is necessary to monitor essential
system parameters. This enhancement proposes the addition of well-known monitoring
endpoints and metrics for each process adhering to the Eclipse MicroProfile standard.

This proposal does not talk about health checks. There is a separate specification for
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health[Health Checks].

=== Motivation

Reliable service of a platform needs monitoring. There is already JMX as
standard to expose metrics, but remote-JMX is not easy to deal with and
especially does not fit well in a polyglot environment where other services
are not running on the JVM.
To enable monitoring in an easy fashion it is necessary that all MicroProfile
implementations follow a certain standard with respect to (base) API path,
data types involved, always available metrics and return codes used.

=== Difference to health checks

Health checks are primarily targeted at a quick yes/no response to the
question "Is my application still running ok?". Modern systems that
schedule the starting of applications (e.g. Kubernetes) use this
information to restart the application if the answer is 'no'.

Metrics on the other hand can help to determine the health. Beyond this
they serve to pinpoint issues, provide long term trend data for capacity
planning and pro-active discovery of issues (e.g. disk usage growing without bounds).
Metrics can also help those scheduling systems decide when to scale the application
to run on more or fewer machines.
