=== API/SPI Changes
** Clarified in the API code that Gauges must return values that extend `java.lang.Number`.  [NOTE: this caused issues with backward compatibility and was reverted in 2.2] (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/304[#304])
** Added the `reusable(boolean)` method for MetadataBuilder (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/407[#407])

** Clarified in the API code that Gauges must return values that extend `java.lang.Number`.  [NOTE: this caused issues with backward compatibility and was reverted in 2.2] (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/304[#304])
** Clarified that implementations can, for JSON export of scopes containing no metrics, omit them, or that they can be present with an empty value. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/416[#416])
** Clarified that metrics should not be created for private methods when a class is annotated (the TCK asserted this in 2.0 anyway) (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/416[#416])
** Added the `reusable(boolean)` method for MetadataBuilder (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/407[#407])

** Added some text to the specification about programmatic creation of metrics (without annotations) (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/399[#399])

=== TCK enhancement
** TCKs are updated to use RestAssured 4.0

=== Miscellaneous
** Explicitly excluded the transitive dependency on `javax.el-api` from the build of the specification. It wasn't actually used anywhere in the build so there should be no impact. 
Implementations can still support the Expression Language if they choose to. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/417[#417])

=== API/SPI Changes
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Refactoring of Counters, as the old `@Counted` was misleading in practice. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/290[#290])
*** Counters via `@Counted` are now always monotonic, the `monotonic` attribute is gone.
The `Counted` interface lost the `dec()` methods.
*** Former non-monotonic counters are now <<app-programming-model#ConcurrentGaugeDef,`@ConcurrentGauge`>> and also in the output reported as gauges. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/290[#290])
*** See <<appendix#migration-hint-to-20, Migration hints>> about migration of applications using MicroProfile Metrics. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/290[#290])
** Removed unnecessary `@InterceptorBinding` annotation from `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.annotation.Metric`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/188[#188])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Removed deprecated `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(String name, Metric, Metadata)` (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/268[#268])
** icon:bolt[role="red"]  `Metadata` is now immutable and built via a <<app-programming-model#pgm-metadata,`MetadataBuilder`>>. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/228[#228])
** Introduced a Tag object which represents a singular tag key/value pair. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** MetricFilter modified to filter with MetricID instead of name. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])

=== Functional Changes
** (2.0.3) Added ProcessCpuTime as a new optional base metric.  (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/454[#454])
** icon:bolt[role="red"]  `Metadata` is now immutable and built via a <<app-programming-model#pgm-metadata,`MetadataBuilder`>>. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/228[#228])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Metrics are now uniquely identified by a <<architecture#metricid-data-def,MetricID>> (combination of the metric's name and tags). (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** MetricFilter modified to filter with MetricID instead of name. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** The 'Metadata' is mapped to a unique metric name in the `MetricRegistry` and this relationship is immutable. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** Tag key names for labels are restricted to match the regex `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** Tag values defined through MP_METRICS_TAGS must escape equal signs `=` and commas `,` with a backslash `\`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] <<rest-endpoints#json-format-def,JSON output format>> for GET requests now appends tags along with the metric in `metricName;tag=value;tag=value` format.
JSON format for OPTIONS requests have been modified such that the 'tags' attribute is a list of nested lists which holds tags from different metrics that
 are associated with the metadata. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/331[#381])
** OpenMetrics format - formerly called Prometheus format
*** Reserved characters in OpenMetrics format must be escaped. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
*** icon:bolt[role="red"] In OpenMetrics output format, the separator between scope and metric name is now a `_` instead of a `:`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/279[#279])
*** icon:bolt[role="red"] Metric names with camelCase are no longer converted to snake_case for OpenMetrics output. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/357[#357])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] The default value of the `reusable` attribute for metric objects created programmatically (not via annotations) is now `true` (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/328[#328])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Some base metrics' names have changed to follow the convention of ending the name of accumulating counters with `total`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/375[#375])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Some base metrics' types have changed from Counter to Gauge since Counters must now count monotonically. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/375[#375])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Some base metrics' names have changed because they now use tags to distinguish metrics for multiple JVM objects. For example,
each existing garbage collector now has its own `gc.total` metric with the name of the garbage collector being in a tag. Names 
of some base metrics in the OpenMetrics output are also affected by the removal of conversion from camelCase to snake_case. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/375[#375])

A full list of changes may be found on the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/milestone/1[MicroProfile Metrics 1.1 Milestone]

=== API/SPI Changes
** `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(String name, Metric, Metadata)` is deprecated.
Use `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(Metadata, Metric)` instead, where `Metadata`
already has a field for the name.

=== Functional Changes
** `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(String name, Metric, Metadata)` is deprecated.
Use `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(Metadata, Metric)` instead, where `Metadata`
already has a field for the name.
** Global tags are now supplied via the means of MicroProfile Config (the env variable is still valid). (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/165[#165])

=== Specification Changes
** Annotations and `Metadata` can now have a flag `reusable` that indicates that the metric name can be registered
more than once. Default is `false` as in Metrics 1.0. See <<architecture#reusing_metrics>>.

=== TCK enhancement
** Improved TCK
