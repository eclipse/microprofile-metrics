=== Major changes to previous versions



* Changes in 2.0
** Refactoring of Counters, as the old `@Counted` was misleading in practise.
*** Counters via `@Counted` are now always monotonic, the `monotonic` attribute is gone.
The `Counted` interface lost the `dec()` methods.
*** Former non-monotonic counters are now `@ConcurrentGauge` and also in the output reported as gauges.
*** See <<migration-hint-to-20, Migration hints>> about migration of applications using MicroProfile Metrics.
** Removed unnecessary `@InterceptorBinding` annotation from `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.annotation.Metric`.
** Removed deprecated `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(String name, Metric, Metadata)`
** `Metadata` is now immutable and built via a `MetadataBuilder`.
** Introduced a Tag object which represents a singular tag key/value pair.
** Metrics are now uniquely identified by a MetricID (combination of the metric's name and tags).
** MetricFilter modified to filter with MetricID instead of name
** The 'Metadata' is mapped to a unique metric name in the `MetricRegistry` and this relationship is immutable.
** Tag key names are restricted to match the regex `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`.
** Tag values defined through MP_METRICS_TAGS must escape equal signs `=` and commas `,` with a backslash `\`.
** JSON format for GET requests now appends tags along with the metric in `metricName;tag=value;tag=value` format. JSON format for OPTIONS requests
have been modified such that the 'tags' attribute is a list of nested lists which holds tags from different metrics that
 are associated with the metadata.
** Reserved characters in Prometheus format must be escaped.
** The default value of the `reusable` attribute for metric objects created programmatically (not via annotations) is now `true`


* Changes in 1.1
** Improved TCK
** `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(String name, Metric, Metadata)` is deprecated.
Use `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(Metadata, Metric)` instead, where `Metadata`
already has a field for the name.
** Global tags are now supplied via the means of MicroProfile Config (the env variable is still valid).
** Annotations and `Metadata` can now have a flag `reusable` that indicates that the metric name can be registered
more than once. Default is `false` as in Metrics 1.0. See <<reusing_of_metrics>>.
