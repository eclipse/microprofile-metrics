=== Major changes to previous versions

* Since 1.0
** Improved TCK
** `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(String name, Metric, Metadata)` is deprecated.
Use `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(Metadata, Metric)` instead, where `Metadata`
already has a field for the name.
** Global tags are now supplied via the means of MicroProfile Config (the env variable is still valid).
** Annotations and `Metadata` can now have a flag `reusable` that indicates that the metric name can be registered
more than once. Default is `false` as in Metrics 1.0. See <<reusing_of_metrics>>.
