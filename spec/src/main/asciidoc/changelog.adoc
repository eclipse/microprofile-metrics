= Release Notes


[[release_notes_4_0]]
== Changes in 4.0

=== Incompatible Changes
** This release aligns with Jakarta EE 9.1, so it won’t work with earlier versions of Jakarta or Java EE (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/639[#639])

[[release_notes_3_0]]
== Changes in 3.0

=== Breaking changes
** Removed everything related to reusability from the API code. All metrics are now considered reusable.
** CDI producers annotated with `@Metric` no longer trigger metric registration. If these metrics should be registered, it must be done differently (for example using the `MetricRegistry` methods)
** `MetricRegistry` changed from `abstract class` to `interface`
** Changed `Timer.update(long duration, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` to `Timer.update(java.time.Duration duration)`
** Removed `MetadataBuilder.withOptional*` methods, the remaining `with*` methods do accept `null` value (considered not present) except `withName` which does not accept `null` or `""`
** Changed `Metadata.getDescription()` and `Metadata.getUnit()` to return `String` instead of `Optional<String>` and added `Metadata.description()` and `Metadata.unit()` that return `Optional<String>`

=== API/SPI Changes

** Added the `MetricRegistry.getMetrics(MetricFilter)` method
** Added the `MetricRegistry.getMetrics(Class, MetricFilter)` method
** Added `SimpleTimer.getMinTimeDuration()` and `SimpleTimer.getMaxTimeDuration()` methods which return a `java.time.Duration` object (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/523[#523])
** Timer class updated  (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/524[#524])
*** Changed `Timer.update(long duration, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` to `Timer.update(java.time.Duration duration)`
*** Added `Timer.getElapsedTime()` which returns `java.time.Duration`
** Removed `MetadataBuilder.withOptional*` methods
** Global tags and `_app` tag are no longer handled automatically by the `MetricID` class, the implementation is expected to add them by itself, for example during metric export
** Added the `Histogram.getSum()` which returns `long` (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/597[#597])


=== Functional Changes
** Simple Timer metrics now track the highest and lowest recorded timing duration of the previous completed minute (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/523[#523])
** Timer now exposes total elapsed time duration as a metric value. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/524[#524]) 
** Clarified that the existing REST metric `REST.request` will not monitor and track a REST request to a REST endpoint if an unmapped exception occurs.
** Introduced a new base REST metric `REST.request.unmappedException.total` that counts the occurrences of unmapped exceptions for each REST endpoint (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/533[#533])
** Histogram now exposes the total sum of recorded values as a `sum` value (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/597[#597])
*** In JSON format it is exposed as a `sum` value
*** In OpenMetrics format it is exposed as a `sum` value under the `summary` type
** Timer now exposes the `elapsedTime` metric value as `sum` under the `summary` type in OpenMetrics format (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/597[#597])

=== Specification Changes
** Removed the concept of reusability
** CDI producers annotated with `@Metric` no longer trigger metric registration
** Clarified how the implementation must handle metrics applied via CDI stereotypes
** The implementation is required to sanitize `Metadata` passed by the application in cases when it does not contain an explicit type,
but the type is implied by the name of the registration method that is being called.
** Clarified that the existing REST metric `REST.request` will not monitor and track a REST request to a REST endpoint if an unmapped exception occurs
** Introduced a new base REST metric `REST.request.unmappedException.total` that counts the occurrences of unmapped exceptions for each REST endpoint (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/533[#533])
** Histogram now exposes the total sum of recorded values as a `sum` value (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/597[#597])
*** In JSON format it is exposed as a `sum` value
*** In OpenMetrics format it is exposed as a `sum` value under the `summary` type
** Timer now exposes the `elapsedTime` metric value as `sum` under the `summary` type in OpenMetrics format (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/597[#597])

=== TCK enhancement
** Improved TCK - Use newly introduced `MetricRegistry` methods to retrieve single metrics and avoid use of the `getMetrics()` and `getMetadata()` methods

=== API/SPI Changes
** Clarified in the API code that Gauges must return values that extend `java.lang.Number`.  [NOTE: this caused issues with backward compatibility and was reverted in 2.2] (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/304[#304])
** Added the `reusable(boolean)` method for MetadataBuilder (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/407[#407])

=== Miscellaneous
** Explicitly excluded the transitive dependency on `jakarta.el-api` from the build of the specification. It wasn't actually used anywhere in the build so there should be no impact.
Implementations can still support the Expression Language if they choose to. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/417[#417])

Changes marked with icon:bolt[role="red"] are breaking changes relative to previous versions of the spec.

=== API/SPI Changes
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Refactoring of Counters, as the old `@Counted` was misleading in practice. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/290[#290])
*** Counters via `@Counted` are now always monotonic, the `monotonic` attribute is gone.
The `Counted` interface lost the `dec()` methods.
*** Former non-monotonic counters are now <<app-programming-model#ConcurrentGaugeDef,`@ConcurrentGauge`>> and also in the output reported as gauges. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/290[#290])
*** See <<appendix#migration-hint-to-20, Migration hints>> about migration of applications using MicroProfile Metrics. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/290[#290])
** Removed unnecessary `@InterceptorBinding` annotation from `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.annotation.Metric`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/188[#188])

** icon:bolt[role="red"]  `Metadata` is now immutable and built via a <<app-programming-model#pgm-metadata,`MetadataBuilder`>>. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/228[#228])
** Introduced a Tag object which represents a singular tag key/value pair. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** MetricFilter modified to filter with MetricID instead of name. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])

=== Functional Changes
** (2.0.3) Added ProcessCpuTime as a new optional base metric.  (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/454[#454])
** icon:bolt[role="red"]  `Metadata` is now immutable and built via a <<app-programming-model#pgm-metadata,`MetadataBuilder`>>. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/228[#228])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Metrics are now uniquely identified by a <<architecture#metricid-data-def,MetricID>> (combination of the metric's name and tags). (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** MetricFilter modified to filter with MetricID instead of name. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** The 'Metadata' is mapped to a unique metric name in the `MetricRegistry` and this relationship is immutable. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** Tag key names for labels are restricted to match the regex `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** Tag values defined through MP_METRICS_TAGS must escape equal signs `=` and commas `,` with a backslash `\`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] <<rest-endpoints#json-format-def,JSON output format>> for GET requests now appends tags along with the metric in `metricName;tag=value;tag=value` format.
JSON format for OPTIONS requests have been modified such that the 'tags' attribute is a list of nested lists which holds tags from different metrics that
 are associated with the metadata. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/331[#381])
** OpenMetrics format - formerly called Prometheus format
*** Reserved characters in OpenMetrics format must be escaped. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
*** icon:bolt[role="red"] In OpenMetrics output format, the separator between scope and metric name is now a `_` instead of a `:`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/279[#279])
*** icon:bolt[role="red"] Metric names with camelCase are no longer converted to snake_case for OpenMetrics output. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/357[#357])

** icon:bolt[role="red"] Some base metrics' names have changed to follow the convention of ending the name of accumulating counters with `total`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/375[#375])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Some base metrics' types have changed from Counter to Gauge since Counters must now count monotonically. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/375[#375])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Some base metrics' names have changed because they now use tags to distinguish metrics for multiple JVM objects. For example,
each existing garbage collector now has its own `gc.total` metric with the name of the garbage collector being in a tag. Names
of some base metrics in the OpenMetrics output are also affected by the removal of conversion from camelCase to snake_case. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/375[#375])

A full list of changes may be found on the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/milestone/1[MicroProfile Metrics 1.1 Milestone]

=== API/SPI Changes
** `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(String name, Metric, Metadata)` is deprecated.
Use `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(Metadata, Metric)` instead, where `Metadata`
already has a field for the name.

=== Functional Changes
** `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(String name, Metric, Metadata)` is deprecated.
Use `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.MetricRegistry.register(Metadata, Metric)` instead, where `Metadata`
already has a field for the name.
** Global tags are now supplied via the means of MicroProfile Config (the env variable is still valid). (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/165[#165])

=== Specification Changes
** Annotations and `Metadata` can now have a flag `reusable` that indicates that the metric name can be registered
