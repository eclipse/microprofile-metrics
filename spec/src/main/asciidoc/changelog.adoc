[[release_notes_4_0]]
== Changes in 4.0

=== Incompatible Changes

[[release_notes_3_0]]
== Changes in 3.0

=== Breaking changes
** Removed everything related to reusability from the API code. All metrics are now considered reusable.

=== Functional Changes
** Simple Timer metrics now track the highest and lowest recorded timing duration of the previous completed minute (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/523[#523])
** Timer now exposes total elapsed time duration as a metric value. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/524[#524]) 
** Clarified that the existing REST metric `REST.request` will not monitor and track a REST request to a REST endpoint if an unmapped exception occurs.
** Introduced a new base REST metric `REST.request.unmappedException.total` that counts the occurrences of unmapped exceptions for each REST endpoint (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/533[#533])
** Histogram now exposes the total sum of recorded values as a `sum` value (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/597[#597])
*** In JSON format it is exposed as a `sum` value
*** In OpenMetrics format it is exposed as a `sum` value under the `summary` type
** Timer now exposes the `elapsedTime` metric value as `sum` under the `summary` type in OpenMetrics format (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/597[#597])

** CDI producers annotated with `@Metric` no longer trigger metric registration
** Clarified how the implementation must handle metrics applied via CDI stereotypes
** The implementation is required to sanitize `Metadata` passed by the application in cases when it does not contain an explicit type,
but the type is implied by the name of the registration method that is being called.
** Clarified that the existing REST metric `REST.request` will not monitor and track a REST request to a REST endpoint if an unmapped exception occurs
** Introduced a new base REST metric `REST.request.unmappedException.total` that counts the occurrences of unmapped exceptions for each REST endpoint (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/533[#533])
** Histogram now exposes the total sum of recorded values as a `sum` value (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/597[#597])
*** In JSON format it is exposed as a `sum` value

Changes marked with icon:bolt[role="red"] are breaking changes relative to previous versions of the spec.

=== API/SPI Changes

*** Counters via `@Counted` are now always monotonic, the `monotonic` attribute is gone.
The `Counted` interface lost the `dec()` methods.
*** Former non-monotonic counters are now <<app-programming-model#ConcurrentGaugeDef,`@ConcurrentGauge`>> and also in the output reported as gauges. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/290[#290])
*** See <<appendix#migration-hint-to-20, Migration hints>> about migration of applications using MicroProfile Metrics. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/290[#290])

** icon:bolt[role="red"]  `Metadata` is now immutable and built via a <<app-programming-model#pgm-metadata,`MetadataBuilder`>>. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/228[#228])
** Introduced a Tag object which represents a singular tag key/value pair. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** MetricFilter modified to filter with MetricID instead of name. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])

=== Functional Changes
** (2.0.3) Added ProcessCpuTime as a new optional base metric.  (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/454[#454])
** icon:bolt[role="red"]  `Metadata` is now immutable and built via a <<app-programming-model#pgm-metadata,`MetadataBuilder`>>. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/228[#228])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Metrics are now uniquely identified by a <<architecture#metricid-data-def,MetricID>> (combination of the metric's name and tags). (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** MetricFilter modified to filter with MetricID instead of name. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** The 'Metadata' is mapped to a unique metric name in the `MetricRegistry` and this relationship is immutable. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** Tag key names for labels are restricted to match the regex `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** Tag values defined through MP_METRICS_TAGS must escape equal signs `=` and commas `,` with a backslash `\`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] <<rest-endpoints#json-format-def,JSON output format>> for GET requests now appends tags along with the metric in `metricName;tag=value;tag=value` format.
JSON format for OPTIONS requests have been modified such that the 'tags' attribute is a list of nested lists which holds tags from different metrics that
 are associated with the metadata. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/331[#381])
** OpenMetrics format - formerly called Prometheus format
*** Reserved characters in OpenMetrics format must be escaped. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/238[#238])
*** icon:bolt[role="red"] In OpenMetrics output format, the separator between scope and metric name is now a `_` instead of a `:`. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/279[#279])
*** icon:bolt[role="red"] Metric names with camelCase are no longer converted to snake_case for OpenMetrics output. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/357[#357])

** icon:bolt[role="red"] Some base metrics' types have changed from Counter to Gauge since Counters must now count monotonically. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/375[#375])
** icon:bolt[role="red"] Some base metrics' names have changed because they now use tags to distinguish metrics for multiple JVM objects. For example,
each existing garbage collector now has its own `gc.total` metric with the name of the garbage collector being in a tag. Names
of some base metrics in the OpenMetrics output are also affected by the removal of conversion from camelCase to snake_case. (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/issues/375[#375])
