=== Alternatives considered

Jolokia JMX-HTTP bridge. Using this for application specific metrics would require those metrics
to be exposed to JMX first, which many users are not familiar with.

=== Example configuration format for base and vendor-specific data


The following is an example configuration in YAML format.

[source]
----
base:
  - name: "thread-count"
    mbean: "java.lang:type=Threading/ThreadCount"
    description: "Number of currently deployed threads"
    unit: "none"
    type: "gauge"
    displayName: "Current Thread count"
  - name: "peak-thread-count"
    mbean: "java.lang:type=Threading/PeakThreadCount"
    description: "Max number of threads"
    unit: "none"
    type: "gauge"
  - name: "total-started-thread-count"
    mbean: "java.lang:type=Threading/TotalStartedThreadCount"
    description: "Number of threads started for this server"
    unit: "none"
    type: "counter"
  - name: "max-heap"
    mbean: "java.lang:type=Memory/HeapMemoryUsage#max"
    description: "Number of threads started for this server"
    unit: "bytes"
    type: "counter"
    tags: "kind=memory"

vendor:
  - name: "msc-loaded-modules"
    mbean: "jboss.modules:type=ModuleLoader,name=BootModuleLoader-2/LoadedModuleCount"
    description: "Number of loaded modules"
    unit: "none"
    type: "gauge"

This configuration can be backed into the runtime or be provided via an external configuration file.

=== Example Metric Registry Factory

.Sample skeleton factory class to produce MetricRegistry via CDI
[source, java]

        return getApplicationRegistry();
    }

    @Produces
    @RegistryType(type = Type.APPLICATION)
    public static MetricRegistry getApplicationRegistry() {
        // Returns the static instance of the Application MetricRegistry
        [...]
    }

    @Produces
    @RegistryType(type = Type.BASE)
    public static MetricRegistry getBaseRegistry() {
        // Returns the static instance of the Base MetricRegistry
        [...]
    }

    @Produces
    @RegistryType(type = Type.VENDOR)
    public static MetricRegistry getVendorRegistry() {
        // Returns the static instance of the Vendor MetricRegistry

=== Migration hints

[[migration-hint-to-20]]
==== To version 2.0

===== @Counted

The `@Counted` annotation has changed. Users of the previous `@Counted` annotation were surprised to learn that by default counters were not monotonic. Also, Prometheus expects all counters to be monotonic.
To migrate:

* Replace `@Counted()` or `@Counted(monotonic=false)` with `@ConcurrentGauge`.
A set of gauges will be created in the OpenMetrics output for each `@ConcurrentGauge`.
* Replace `@Counted(monotonic=true)` with `@Counted` (monotonic flag is gone)

This change has also had an impact on the `Counter` interface to basically follow the above change:

* Replace usages where `Counter.dec()` was called with `Gauge` or `ConcurrentGauge`
